					<p>   Born October 7th, 1986 in a hospital in St. Louis to father, Steven Johnston and mother Mindy Paul <i>(nee Parsons)</i>. His artistic ability arose earlier, as evident in the infamous drawing with a nose his mother dotes on about.</p>
					<p>After the death of his father at the age of four, his paternal family began injecting themselves into his life, acting as sort of a guidance in the absense of his father. His Uncle Greg introduced him to the performing arts, while his grandmother Georgia and grandfather <i>(his father's step-father)</i> John introduced him to the aesthetic arts. Together, unbeknownst to them, they introduced a perspective to a young reclusive theMITCHARONI.
					<p>Around the age of 10, theMITCHARONI discovered video game magazines, and japanese art. This began to influence his style more into a more comical manner. This continued on through his formative years, slowly combining art styles of modern american comics and cartoons with that of japanese comics and cartoons(manga and anime).</p>
					<p>About the age of 17, theMITCHARONI began his love of early 20th century artists, namely Pablo Picasso. Painting wasn't something theMITCHARONI was able to pick up at the time, and entered an age of depression, deciding to focus on music over art until his late twenties.</p>
					<p>Around the age of 29, theMITCHARONI began experimenting with acrylic paints. It was becoming a trend to paint, and he had decided he wanted to get back into art again. A few years later, he discovered <b>Acrylic Pour Painting</b> through his friend Josie. After experimenting, it took of and theMITCHARONI doesn't see an end in sight to his <b>Acrylic Pour Painting</b> endeavours.
